# Bridge Validator

This repo holds the implementation for the validator of the native N3<>Bane bridge.

## How to run

```bash
make all
```

The binary will be created on the `./bin` dir.

Then:

```bash
./bin/bridge-validator
```

For the moment, check `.env.template` for the config params. Copy the template to a `.env` file in the same directory.
